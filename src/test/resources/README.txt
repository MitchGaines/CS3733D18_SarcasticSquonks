Put resources (data, images, FXML files, etc.) needed by your *test cases* here. Anything placed here will be
invisible to the main java program, and anything placed in the main resources folder will be invisible to your
unit tests.

THESE RESOURCES ARE IMMUTABLE, DO *NOT* TRY TO WRITE TO THEM IN JAVA CODE!
