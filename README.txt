To assemble a jar file for your project, run the "jar" gradle task, either through IntelliJ or by doing
`gradle jar` on a terminal. Gradle will automatically download all dependencies needed to compile your jar file,
which will be stored in the build/libs folder.

Make sure to edit the main class attribute the build.gradle file, you'll need to change it in order to obtain
a working jar file.
